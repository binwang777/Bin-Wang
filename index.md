# LHconcat

## About us
LHconcat is from the School of Computer Science, Shanxi University.    http://cs.sxu.edu.cn/

Currently our main direction is low-level vision tasks such as super-resolution, image dehazing, low-light enhancement and image dehazing. At the same time, we are also actively exploring the combination of high and low-level tasks. Such as detection, identification and segmentation in severe weather environments.


## Member Introduction
### Leader
Liang Yudong, Ph.D., associate professor. His research interests are computer vision, image processing, and computer vision, focusing on image enhancement (image dehazing, super-resolution), image quality evaluation, and low-quality image target detection.
